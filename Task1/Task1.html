      <p>
        Iâ€™m Arun Tomar, a passionate BCA student at TMU with a strong interest in web development and AI. I build interactive front-end projects using React.js, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. I'm currently diving deep into Python and machine learning to bridge the gap between development and intelligence. I believe in practical learning, and my aim is to become a skilled AI-powered web developer. Every line of code I write is a step toward creating something meaningful for the future.
